Description: high-performance CORBA implementation - extra libraries
 CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) is an architecture
 that enables program objects to communicate, sending requests and
 receiving replies, between different applications, regardless of their
 programming language, operating system or network location.
 .
 This package contains extra run-time libraries needed by some
 applications that communicate with each other using the ORBit2
 implementation of CORBA.
