Description: Development files for the GLib library
 GLib is a library containing many useful C routines for things such
 as trees, hashes, lists, and strings.  It is a useful general-purpose
 C library used by projects such as GTK+, GIMP, and GNOME.
 .
 This package is needed to compile programs against libglib2.0-0,
 as only it includes the header files and static libraries (optionally)
 needed for compiling.
