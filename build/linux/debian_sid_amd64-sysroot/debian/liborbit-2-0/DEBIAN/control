Description: high-performance CORBA implementation - common libraries
 CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) is an architecture
 that enables program objects to communicate, sending requests and
 receiving replies, between different applications, regardless of their
 programming language, operating system or network location.
 .
 This package contains the run-time libraries needed by applications
 that communicate with each other using the ORBit2 implementation of
 CORBA.
